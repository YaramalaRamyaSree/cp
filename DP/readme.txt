Every problem first we slove using
                                    1.recursion 
                                    2.memoization
                                    3.tabulation
                                    4.space optimization 
                                    
In recursion Time complexity will be exponential and space complexity is input and auxilary recursion stack space.
In memoization we optimise time complexity drastically (by observing overlapping sub problems) and we use a strategy to store values in a table/map/array.
In tabulation we even eliminate recursion stack space which is in memoization  and we do bottom up time complexity remains same as memoization.
We even optimise space in tabulation i.e space optimization to every problem = this will be most efficient approach for a given problem .
